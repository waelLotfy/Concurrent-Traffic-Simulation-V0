# Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation

This project simulates traffic in a city grid with vehicles, streets and intersections. Vehicles drive around randomly 
and change direction. Each object in the city grid will run independently in its own thread.

I have added some new features in order to work for its intended puporse.
